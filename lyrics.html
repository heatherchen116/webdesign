				I'll never stop trying to make you love me, oh<br>
                Even if we're stuck in a rut, <br>
                Doesn't matter how long we've been together, <br>
                I'll be right there, right there, right there, <br>
                Ohhh, we're never giving up, <br>
                I won't stop.<br>
                <br>
                Stop,<br>
                Just wait,<br>
                We've travelled this old road before, <br>
                And always come around.<br>
                Stop,<br>
                Don't think,<br>
                Just love,<br>
                Ain't nothing gonna bring us down.<br>
                <br>
                I'll never stop trying to let you love me, <br>
                Hmm, even if we're stuck in a rut, <br>
                No, through all this mess we've been together, <br>
                I'll be right there, right there, <br>
                I won't stop. <br>
                <br>
                Stop,<br>
                Just wait,<br>
                We've travelled this old road before, <br>
                And always come around.<br>
                Stop,<br>
                Don't think,<br>
                Just love,<br>
                Ain't nothing gonna bring us down.<br>
                <br>
                We can yell how we want to, <br>
                That won't change a thing, <br>
                We can pay someone to listen <br>
                And fix it temporarily, <br>
                Or, we can stand up <br>
                And fight for the life we built, <br>
                Love will always save us, <br>
                Love will always win.<br>
                <br>
                (Stay) Stop, <br>
                Just wait,<br>
                We've travelled this old road before, <br>
                And always come around.<br>
                Stop,<br>
                Don't think,<br>
                Just love,<br>
                Ain't nothing gonna bring us down.<br>
                <i>[2x]</i><br>
                Stop.
